# minesweeper-eecs448
This implementation of Minesweeper has tried to remain true to the game's Windows 3.1 roots while using more modern technologies. The application is built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), makes use of a remote JSON storage service by the name of [myjson](http://myjson.com), and is ready for deployment as a Docker container.
